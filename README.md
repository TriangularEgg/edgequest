# edgequest
Roguelike in Python based on the [Roguebasin Tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod) but with several key differences, namely being the feature to store items and monsters inside of JSON files, making modular additions possible without needing to alter the python source in any way.

## Requirements
1. Python 2.7
2. Enough edge to cut yourself on
3. 10 minutes of free time

## Run Edgequest

#### Linux

It should be as simple as running:

`python2.7 edgequest.py`

in the edgequest directory from a terminal

All imports are from the standard library, so you should have no problem with running this on a linux machine

#### Windows

Currently does not run on windows
