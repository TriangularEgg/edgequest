# Contributing to EdgeQuest

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

## Creating an Issue

The easiest way to contribute to EdgeQuest is to raise issues on the github issue tracker. You can either make bug reports, or suggest changes.

### Bug Report

If you come across a bug in the game, please tell us, and file a bug report!

If you want to make a bug report, follow these steps:
* **Make sure your bug is valid** and sure you can reproduce it, or it will be thrown out.
* **Make sure you have the latest master** because EdgeQuest changes frequently, and your bug may have been fixed.
* **Make sure your issue hasn't been raised before** for someone else might have beaten you to the punch, and you should instead contribute to that issue instead of making a new one.
* **Proof always helps.** Attaching images will always be a huge help in resolving your problem.
* **Be professional.** Please do not swear, or harrass others, or your issue will be removed.

### Suggesting Changes

If you want to make suggestions, feel free. We really appreciate community feedback.

If you want to make a suggestion, follow these steps:
* **Make sure someone else hasn't suggested it.** This isn't likely to happen, but you should always check.
* **Make sure it's a feasible goal.** We can't incorporate things that are ridiculous.
* **Make sure your issue isn't petty.** Issues such as 'the game is hard make it easy' will be removed.
* **Be professional.** Please do not swear, or harrass others, or your issue will be removed.

## Pull Requests

If you want to directly modify EdgeQuest, here are some guidelines you should be following

### Styleguide

Your code must adhere to the following:
* **Readable.** If I can't tell what's happening, chances are it will be removed.
* **PEP8 has no sway here.** This project's max characters per line is around 90ish. Do NOT sacrifice readability for PEP8. Follow this styleguide instead of PEP8.
* **One newline between each class and function.** Self explanatory.
* **Docstring immediately following function definition, class defintion, and class methods.** Self explanatory.
* **80 line closing comment of hyphens before and after function definitions, global variables, and classes.** See edgequest.py for examples.
* **Name of file as a comment at the top of file, capitalized.** Self explanatory
* **JSON in json folder.** Self explanatory.
* **Commented.** Absolutely crucial. The other stuff is secondary to this by far.

### Commit messages

Make sure your commit messages are clear, proffesional, and concise. That's it.
