## Dungeon
- Structure generator lacks several important features being
  1. The ability to rotate structures
  2. Ability to preserve tiles the structure will be placed on, aka 'holes' in the structure tilemap
- Dungeon generation is rather lacking in variety. See https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/07/28/how-do-roguelikes-generate-levels/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/6df0aw/my_implementation_of_a_bunch_of_dungeon_algorithms/ for ideas
